Pandwarf Defender is an Android Application :
* able to **catch any radio signal** at a given frequency,
* able to **detected an brute force attack**
* and able to retort to **neutralize the attack** by means of interference.


Easy to use..

You can custom any parameters to improve if necessary.
(I will explain all parameters later.)

If you have many alarms you can save/load many configurations.
Configurations are by default stored in *Documents/PandwarfDefender/configs*

Next Iteration:
Contact a server when a brute force attack is detected :)))
